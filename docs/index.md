# Introduction

These docs are the how-to part of the blog post 
[A Personal Information Management System: Introducing Scrapbook][blog].
In that post we talk about the ideas behind building our own personal information management system (PIM), that we call Scrapbook. These
document pages and code provide a concrete template for building your own Scrapbook application. It's sort of a Scrapbook 101 app to get
you up and going.

To see an example of this code in action, go to [TBD][demo]. Note that this is still a work in progress. :runner:
