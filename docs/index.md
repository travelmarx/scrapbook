# Introduction

These docs are the how-to part of the blog post 
[A Personal Information Management System: Introducing Scrapbook][1].
In that post we talk about the ideas behind building our own personal information management system (PIM), that we call Scrapbook. These
document pages and code provide a concrete template for building your own Scrapbook application. It's sort of a Scrapbook 101 app to get
you up and going.

If you don't feel like running this code and just want to see it in action, a running sample version of this code with sample data is provided here [TBD][2].

## Required

We build this using using Microsoft tools and software. You can get started with not cost to you with the following software running locally:

* [Visual Studio Community][3]
* [Azure Cosmos DB Local Emulator][4]

When you have played around locally and you want to take the next step by publishing your site live, you would add the following pieces:

* Azure Cosmos DB Service
* Azure Application Service

The Scrapbook 101 code was build by starting with the perennial to-do list app and customizing it.
