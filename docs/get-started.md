## Run locally

Webuild the Scrapbook 101 app on Winddows with the following tools.

* [Visual Studio Community][vsdown]  
* [Azure Cosmos DB Local Emulator][emul]

After starting the local emulator, there is an option to download code samples you can start from.

## Run live

After running locally, the next step is  publishing your site live with the following services:

- [Azure Cosmos DB Service][cosmos]
  - Works the same as local and you can copy any documents created locally to the live service.
 
* [Azure Application Service][azapp]
  - Publish directly from Visual Studio to the Azure Application service.

Be sure to take advantage of any limited, free use offers from Azure.
