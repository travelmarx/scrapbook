## Run locally

Here we describe the path we took to build the Scrapbook 101 app, which is on Winddows with the following tools:

* [Visual Studio Community][vsdown]  

* [Azure Cosmos DB Local Emulator][emul]

After starting the local emulator, there is an option to download code samples you can start from.

## Run live

After running locally, the next step is  publishing your site live with the following services:

* Azure Cosmos DB Service
 ** Works the same as local and you can copy any work locally to the live service.
 
* Azure Application Service
 ** Publish directly from Visual Studio to the Azure Application service.
